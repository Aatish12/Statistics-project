 # Statistics-project
    This is the project for statistical analysis for course of statistics.It provides the begginer approach of analysis
 # Introduction
    This project gives the information about the analysis of Haberman's survival data set.The dataset contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital on  the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.
    
  Number of Instances: 306
  Number of Attributes: 4 (including the class attribute)
 
 Attribute Information:
   1. Age of patient at time of operation (numerical)
   2. Patient's year of operation (year - 1900, numerical)
   3. Number of positive axillary nodes detected (numerical)
   4. Survival status (class attribute)
         1 = the patient survived 5 years or longer
         2 = the patient died within 5 year
         
    Dependent variable:Survaival data
    Independent variable:Age,Year of Operation,No. of positive axillary nodes
    
# Research Questions and Hypothesis
      As we have the information about the Haberman's survival dataset,we have to check the effect of dependent variable and independent variable.The Hypothesis will like this-
      Ho=No Independent variable affect to dependent variable. 
      Ha=There are significant variable which affect on dependent variable.
      
  As we have only one sample.This dataset contains the categorical data.So I choose the Chi-Squred Gopdness of fit test.As we don't know the mean of the population we can't use z-test.So I use Graphpad software to calculate chi-square.
